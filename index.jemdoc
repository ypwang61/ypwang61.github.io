== About me
I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering from University of Washington. 
I feel very fortunate to have worked under the guidance of [https://simonshaoleidu.com/index.html Prof. Simon Shaolei Du] since 2022.

My main research interest lies in *machine learning theory*, especially the foundations of deep learning and representation learning. 
I am also very interested in *designing practical machine learning algorithms* with strong theoretical guarantees.
Furthermore, I always held a strong enthusiasm for the cross-cutting area of mathematics, physics, and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in [http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/ Computer Science & Technology] from [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University] in 2023, with an honor degree from [http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/main.psp Chu Kochen Honors College].
I also minored in [http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/main.psp Mathematics] at [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University]. 
During my undergraduate, I was very fortunate to work closely with [http://yuandong-tian.com/ Dr. Yuandong Tian], [https://www.huaxiuyao.io/ Prof. Huaxiu Yao], and [https://linjunz.github.io/ Prof. Linjun Zhang] on several research projects.
