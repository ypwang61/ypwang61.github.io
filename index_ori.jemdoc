== About me
I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering from University of Washington. 
I feel very fortunate to have worked under the guidance of [https://simonshaoleidu.com/index.html Prof. Simon Shaolei Du] since 2022 summer.

My main research interest broadly spread across *machine learning theory* and *foundation models*. 
For the theortical part, I care about understanding the foundations of deep learning and representation learning, especially the *training dynamics of* the basic components like *Transformer*. 
For the empirical part, I am keen on developing efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees or insightful observations. In this aspect, currently I'm working on *data selection/scheduling for multi-modal pretraining* and improving model efficiency.
In addition, I always hold a strong enthusiasm for understanding the essence of intelligence and exploring the cross-cutting areas of mathematics, physics, and AGI, such as using LLM for mathematical proof.

Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in [http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/ Computer Science & Technology] from [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University] in 2023, with an honor degree from [http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/main.psp Chu Kochen Honors College].
I also minored in [http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/main.psp Mathematics] at [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University]. 
During my undergraduate, I was very fortunate to work closely with [http://yuandong-tian.com/ Dr. Yuandong Tian], [https://www.huaxiuyao.io/ Prof. Huaxiu Yao], and [https://linjunz.github.io/ Prof. Linjun Zhang] on several exciting research projects and learned a lot.

    Preprint. \n
    tl;dr: We design universal data selection methods for CLIP pretraining and achieve near SOTA results with less than 10% of preprocessing resources. It can achieve a new SOTA in [https://www.datacomp.ai/dcclip/leaderboard.html DataComp benchmark] when combined with current best approaches.

    International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024 \n
    tl;dr: We analyze the training dynamics of multilayer transformer, characterizing the role of self-attention, MLP nonlinearity, and the learning procedure of hierarchical structure, if the data follow hierarchical generative models.
